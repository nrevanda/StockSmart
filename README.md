# StockSmart 🧠📦  
**Warehouse Inventory Management System**

---

## 💼 Business Understanding  
Many small to medium-sized warehouses or agribusiness companies still manage their inventory manually using paper or spreadsheets. This often leads to inefficient tracking, misplaced items, and stock shortages that disrupt operations.  

This project aims to provide a simple, accessible, and lightweight inventory management tool built with Python. By offering a command-line interface (CLI), warehouse staff can easily monitor inventory, record item movements, and receive low-stock alerts which definetly improving operational efficiency without needing complex software.
