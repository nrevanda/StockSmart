# CRUD Project -- **Warehouse Inventory Management System**
<br>

## Business understanding
Many small to medium-sized warehouses or agribusiness companies still manage their inventory manually using paper or spreadsheets. This often leads to inefficient tracking, lost items, and stock shortages that disrupt operations.
This project aims to create a simple and accessible inventory management tool using Python. By providing a command-line interface (CLI), warehouse staff can easily monitor inventory, record item movements, and receive low-stock alerts whihc obviously improving operational efficiency without needing a complex system.

  **Benefits:**
1. Clear and structured inventory records
2.  Helps prevent stock shortages through low-stock alerts
3. Tracks item movement history for auditing purposes
4. Supports faster, more accurate logistics decisions
5.  Lightweight and easy to run on most systems (no internet required)

  **Features:**
1. CRUD operations for inventory data (Create, Read, update & delete)
2. Stock movement history (`"IN"` and `"OUT"` records)
3. Search and filter by item name, category, amount etc.
4. Sort database by ID, stock, category etc.
5. Low-stock notifications
6. Auto generated mutation ID
7. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
